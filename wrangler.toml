# If you use the Wrangler CLI to publish Pages, either populate your account_id
# here or run `wrangler pages project init --name unity-smp-site` which will
# generate a Pages-tailored configuration for your account.
# account_id can be your Cloudflare account ID. The value below was provided by you.

# Cloudflare Pages output directory (used by Wrangler and Pages deployments)
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"

# NOTE:
# - Do NOT include a `[site]` table for Pages projects; it is not supported by
#   the Pages configuration validator. The `pages_build_output_dir` top-level
#   key is the Pages-compatible way to point Wrangler/Pages at your static output.
# - If you later add Cloudflare Functions or a Worker entry, you may need to add
#   a top-level `main = "index.js"` (or similar) instead of `site.entry-point`.

                <h2>Why Unity Exists</h2>
                <p>Unity SMP was born from a simple dream: to create a space where creativity knows no bounds and
                    friendships flourish naturally. What started as a passion project has blossomed into a thriving
                    world where players come together for something more than just the game.</p>
                <p>This server is more than just blocks and builds — it's a community where every player's vision
                    matters, where collaboration outshines competition, and where the journey is just as important as
                    the destination. Whether you're a master architect, a redstone engineer, or someone who just loves
                    to explore and make friends, Unity is your home away from home.</p>

                        <ul>
                            Here is a full list of the notes of the build move:

                            <li>Create back up of world 2025-09-13_04-59-14</li>
                            <li>Reset chunks with creative build on them + some surrounding chunks to enable
                                natural terrain generation – coordinates are linked above</li>
                            <li>Added extra torches/lanterns below pasted build to manage mob spawning and
                                removed some trees</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>🔧 General Notes</h4>
                        <p>There is no link change for Tailscale and everything is running as normal. Also, some
                            server-side performance patches were added courtesy of May to reduce RAM and CPU
                            usage so you should notice minimal lag within the server at all times. The server will still
                            reset twice a day as scheduled, again to help with performance and to keep lag to a
                            minimum. The backup schedule also has not changed and will still be backed up every two
                            days. As far as data loss is concerned during the moving and rechunking process, excellent
                            news!! There was no data loss!! Everything should be the same as you left your items
                            when the server was shut down.</p>

                        <p>No roll back or anything of that nature was needed. The VM simply needed to be refreshed
                            which happens from time to time. This lowers RAM usage and over is good for the health of
                            the VM and the server. You should not much less lag and much less stuttering. Since, the VM
                            needed to be restarted, I did have to rotate the key as is standard procedure for security
                            of the VM and all of you. I also made sure I made the key reusable for everyone and not a
                            one time link (That was 100% my bad last time).</p>
